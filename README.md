1. As a required deliverables I had to create a CSV file containing a sorted list of the top 'n' members for outreach, please note that I uploaded such CSV file named [output.csv](data/output.csv) to data folder containing a sorted list of the top 'n' members for outreach. also note that the rank is based on predicted_survival_probs variable and the lower it is the higher rank the member gets.
